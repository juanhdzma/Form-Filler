# Form-Filler

This is a Python template for automating web form filling using Selenium and CSV data.

## Features

-   Uses **Selenium WebDriver** to interact with web forms.
-   Reads input data from a **CSV file**.
-   Fills out **text fields, passwords, and text areas** dynamically.
-   Implements **delays** to ensure smooth interaction with the webpage.
-   Can be used for **automating repetitive form submissions, testing web applications, or data entry tasks**.

## How It Works

1. **Loads a CSV file** containing form data.
2. **Opens a web page** using Selenium.
3. **Locates input fields** and fills them with corresponding data.
4. **Submits the form** and repeats for each entry in the CSV.

This template is ideal for **QA testing, automation scripts, and bulk form submissions**. ðŸš€
